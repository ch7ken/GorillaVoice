# GorillaVoice

GorillaVoice is a mod for Gorilla Tag that utilizes the speech recognition system built in the system to implement voice commands into Gorilla Tag,
GorillaVoice is currently a private mod and it is not planned to be released to the public anytime soon as it is mainly being used as a personal mod, I plan to release something similar later on in the future but for now GorillaVoice will remain a private mod
