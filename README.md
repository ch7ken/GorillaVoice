# GorillaVoice

GorillaVoice is a mod for Gorilla Tag that utilizes the speech recognition system built in the system to implement voice commands into Gorilla Tag,
GorillaVoice is currently a private mod and it is not planned to be released to the public anytime soon as it is mainly being used as a personal mod, I plan to release something similar later on in the future but for now GorillaVoice will remain a private mod

All of these files you see here are just being used for the mod, such as the RoomList.txt, it's a list of random private rooms that I will join upon running a certain voice command and the CommandSound is the sound that plays when a command is ran, mone of these are actually useful to the public and I don't think they will be lmao, also, part of the reason I do not plan to release GorillaVoice to the public is it contains a little personal information and contains realtime data of what code i'm in, what time it is for me, my current nickname and more so I can have certain features
